# FileSystem-2

Computer Organization and Operating System Assignment (Chapter: File System, Sec: 2)

## Overview

## Key Areas of Focus
1. **Files, Directories and FHS:** The Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS) defines the directory structure and directory contents in Unix-like operating systems. It is maintained by the Linux Foundation and defines the names, locations, and permissions for many file types and directories.
2. **Raw Media Devices:** In computing, a raw device is a special kind of logical device that allows a storage device such as a hard disk drive to be accessed directly, bypassing the operating systemâ€™s caches and buffers.
3. **Physical Volume Administration:** Physical volumes are the underlying physical storage units of an LVM (Logical Volume Manager) logical volume, which can be a block device such as a partition or whole disk. They must be initialized as physical volumes to be used for an LVM logical volume. 
4. **Volume Group Administration:**  Volume groups are created by combining physical volumes, creating a pool of disk space out of which logical volumes can be allocated. They provide a layer of abstraction over physical storage, creating a logical storage volume.
5. **Logical Volume Administration:** Logical volume management involves creating and managing logical volumes, which are virtual block storage devices that a file system, database, or application can use. They are created from the pool of disk space provided by volume groups.
6. **File System Type:** A file system is a method and data structure that the operating system uses to control how data is stored and retrieved. There are numerous types of file systems, each with its own structure and logic, such as NTFS, FAT32, exFAT, and EXT2/2/4.
7. **Archiver, Backup/Restore Tools:** These are software tools that allow you to create backups of your data and restore them when needed. They can back up individual files and/or whole folders to and from a location on a local drive or network folder, as well as save backups to a free cloud storage service.
